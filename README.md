# GoTo School 2017

These files were created by me while I was taking courses at GoTo School.

## Images

There are two programs for image processing in this folder. One of them adds red filter to the image, another one makes image black and white. The folder also contains an example file called `ironman.jpg`.

### Requirements

- PIL

## Faces

This folder contains different versions of a program that replaces faces on a picture with matching emojis using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/services/cognitive-services/face/) service.

### Requirements

- PIL
- requests

## Music

This is a sound processing program that makes sound file ten times higher and reverses it.

### Requirements

- wave
- struct

## Events

It was supposed to be a site with some upcoming events (as an example I used three films that were about to have a premiere in Russia at the moment I was creating this site) where people would be able to sign up for these events. It was my first site that used a database ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)). Web application is based on [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/). Later I created dockerfile for this site.

### Requirements

- pymongo
- tornado
